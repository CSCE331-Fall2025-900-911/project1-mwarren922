                            FLiNT is an organization that seeks to give freshman students experience with engineering projects, equipping them with problem-solving skills for job seeking. I was a member of the Union Committee, which organized community service events such as cleaning parks, building ramps for disabled homeowners, and collaborating with Big Event, TAMUâ€™s largest community service project.

                            Serving on the Union Committee, we devised an engineering project to create a PET plastic-to-filament converter that would recycle water bottles. The design consisted of a cylinder to hold the bottle, with a razor to cut it into a small strip. This strip was fed through a heating element into a spool. This whole process was controlled by an Arduino that spins the spool and adjusts the temperature of the heating element.
